<b3> Hello, my name is Fatima and I am 21 years old. I am currently in my third year of university, studying History at the University of Warwick. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and swimming, and I also enjoy eating out and visiting cafes with my friends. My favourite pastime is finding an independent cafe and reading a bit of fiction with a flat white, something I miss a lot during this quarantine! I also enjoy writing, and I am the Finance Editor of the student newspaper The Boar, and have written many articles which I have linked below. I am very excited to be learning how to use web development tools such as HTML, so much so that I have convinced my younger sister to sign up to these classes as they are fantastic!</b3>
